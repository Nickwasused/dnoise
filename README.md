# dnoise
DNS noise generator that looks at your network activity and blends in. Requires [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) to run.

The blue graph line marks queries generated by dnoise, blending in with peaks and valleys of organic traffic.

## Dependencies
### Raspberry Pi

```
python3 -m venv .
source bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
sudo apt-get install python3-pandas
```

### Other
```
python3 -m venv .
source bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Recommended setup
- Use [Unbound](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/) or [Knot-resolver](https://knot-resolver.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart-install.html)
- Pair this with [dnscrypt-proxy](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy) or some other DNSCrypt/DoH client to make sure your ISP can't snoop on your queries.

1. Run this on the same machine that hosts your pi-hole instance.
2. Rename the `config.example.json` to `config.json`
3. Fill in the auth field of the config by getting the `WEBPASSWORD` from the Pi-hole config by typing `sudo cat /etc/pihole/setupVars.conf` on the Pi-hole server.
4. Put this in your `crontab -e` to make it run after reboot:  
`@reboot /home/pi/dnoise/bin/python3 /home/pi/dnoise/dnoise.py`
5. That's all there is to it. The script will sample network activity every minute and add 10% extra DNS queries made randomly to Cisco's top 1M domain list.
